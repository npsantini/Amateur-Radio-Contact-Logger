# Amateur-Radio-Contact-Logger

## Previous Work

The previous work that I have done on this project is outlined in this video [https://youtu.be/7wImo16Hec0](https://youtu.be/7wImo16Hec0)

In that version you could log contacts and look up contacts only. This is a problem because there was no way to assign the contacts to any one person. 

**Anything committed from 4 months ago is considered prior work and should not be considered for the MLH Snacks and Hackers hackathon.**

Plans for this hackathon include adding user account functionality as well as user searchability to see logged contacts. A stretch goal will be to use Google Cloud services to host the Postgresql database.
